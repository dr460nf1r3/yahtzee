        <article><h1>Yahtzee üé≤</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a simple implementation of the Yahtzee game in plain JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
This was part of a project week in school where we had to implement a game in 2.5 days.
The game is implemented using classes and objects, and the code is documented using JSDoc.
The game is designed to be played by one player only, but can be easily extended to support multiple players.
Since we couldn't use any libraries or frameworks, it isn't the most beautiful implementation, but it works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è</p>
<p>The implementation is based on the rules of the game as described on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Wikipedia</a>.
Design is desktop-first and not designed with mobiles in mind.</p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser / alternatively use the <a href="https://yahtzee.dr460nf1r3.org/">GitHub Pages</a>
link.</li>
<li>Click on the dice to roll them.</li>
<li>Click on the dice you want to keep, if desired.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;Roll&quot; button to roll the dice you didn't keep.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have rolled the dice three times.</li>
<li>Click on the category you want to score in.</li>
<li>The game will automatically calculate your score and update the total score.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2‚Äì7 until you have scored in all categories.</li>
</ol>
<h2>JSDoc / class diagram</h2>
<p>The code is documented using JSDoc,
and can be either in the <code>docs</code> folder or on <a href="https://yahtzee.dr460nf1r3.org/docs/Yahtzee.html">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
